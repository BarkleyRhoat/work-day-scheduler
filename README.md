# work-day-scheduler
calendar application that allows users to save events 

## Description

This is a calender that allows you to input events on the time block and once you click the save button it will be stored and will show up the next time you visit page. The only time it will disapear is when you write something different in the time block. 

It syncs up with the current time of my system. So when it is after those hours the time blocks will be gray, when its present time the time block will be red, when the time hasnt happened yet the time block will be green. 

This calender uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.
